Congratulations, you have led your favorite team 
of ducks into victory!
To reset the game, simply delete:
player.json, entities_saved.json, misc.json, (optionally) achievements_acquired.json, and quests.json. 
I also recommend you delete your app.log if you didn't notice
any bugs so it doesn't keep growing on you.
